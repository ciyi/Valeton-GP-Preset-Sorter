**About Valeton GP Preset Sorter**
----------
The native Valeton software does not have a functionality to move presets. 

I've created this application to easily reorganise your presets at will. 

For now, I've only tested it on a Valeton GP-100 firmware 1.7.

Feel free to report bugs. If you own a GP-200/LT, send me a presets file and I'll try to take a look at it.
